                        <p>Today was the first day of class. The first thing I did was review what we were going to do today.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Work together mostly</li>

                        </header>
                        <p>We then talked about which languages we speak.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We did a show of hands to see who speaks English, Japanese, or French. What about different combinations?</li>
                            <li>I mentioned that in class we will use mostly English, some French, and some Japanese.</li>
                            <li>I mentioned that I can also speak Portuguese and American Sign Language. One of the students speaks Korean, and he gave us an example.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                        </header>
                        <h4 id="rules">Rules</h4>
                        <p>Since this was the first class, I wanted to establish some ground rules. These included:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ask before you touch other computers.</li>
                            <li>Don't listen to videos or internet or video games unless directly related to a project and with permission.</li>
                            <li>Make it easy for others to work: be quiet, helpful, thoughtful</li>
                            <li>Treat all equipment properly and clean up carefully.</li>
                            <li>Take turns when speaking.</li>
                            <li>Listen when others are speaking.</li>
                            <li>Make this a fun place: Be respectful. Use nice language, touch, and manners.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 id="expectations">Expectations</h4>
                        <p>I also mentioned some of my expectation for the kids, which is to say rules that help me keep the class safe and focused on learning and having fun.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Listen when asked. Pay attention.</li>
                            <li>Do when asked. As soon as is reasonable.</li>
                            <li>Do as asked. Follow directions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 id="procedures">Procedures</h4>
                        <p>I also went over some important class procedures, and why they were there</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>When you need to go to the bathroom, go. When you get out, WASH YOUR HANDS! (Why?)</strong> (Obviously this one is very important)</li>
                            <li>When you don't understand, ask</li>
                            <li>When you want to help, great! BUT, use words. Help without touching. (Why?)</li>
                            <li>When someone helps you, listen carefully and use their good ideas. Do it yourself!</li>
                            <li>When the teacher is busy, be patient.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="classTopic">
                        <header>
                            <h3 id="name-game">Name Game?</h3>
                        </header>
                        <p>The first game we played was the classic &quot;name game&quot;. Kids were very excited and eager to meet the challenge. The rules were:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Say the person's name and throw the newspaper to them.</li>
                            <li>If it falls, go back to the begining</li>
                            <li>Go in the same order each time</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We did this a few times until everyone knew each other's name (especially me) and then we did it again to try for speed. We didn't go much faster, but had fun.</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>I prepared for the next game by talking about computer language. For example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There are <em>special Words</em> for computers</li>
                            <li>Most of the <em>special words</em> are in English</li>
                            <li>The meaning of <em>special words</em> is sometimes different than the usual word, for example, <em>mouse</em>.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="classTopic">
                        <header>
                            <h3 id="teacher-says">Teacher Says</h3>
                        </header>
                        <p>We played a game whose purpose was to make sure everyone knew some basic vocabulary for user actions, and how to perform the actions. Since I expected to have to use this vocabulary often, I wanted to be sure the kids would know
                            it. The rules were:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If I say &quot;Teacher Says&quot; it means everyone does what I say.</li>
                            <li>If I don't say &quot;Teacher Says&quot;, no one does anything.</li>
                            <li>If I don't say it, and you do it, you have to kneel for one turn.</li>
                            <li>If I say it, and you don't do it, you have to kneel for one turn.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The kinds of vocabulary and actions we practiced were:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>First Set: Tap, Hold, Let Go</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Tap</strong> your <em>nose</em></p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Tap</strong> your <em>nose</em> <em>2 times</em>, <em>3 times</em>, <em>4 times</em>, etc.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Tap</strong> <em>slowly, quickly, smoothly, roughly, soft, hard</em></p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Double Tap</strong> your nose</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>same with <em>ear</em>, <em>knee</em>, <em>table</em>, som <em>classmate</em>, <em>computer</em></p>

                            <li><strong>scroll</strong> on the table, face, leg, etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>scroll up</strong>, <strong>scroll down</strong>, <strong>scroll right</strong>, <strong>scroll left</strong></li>

                        <p>We made sure everyone could turn the tablet on, off, and get to the Scratch program.</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>We then started using the scratch program itself. Most of the kids knew how to open the program and start a new project.</p>
                        <p>Once we were at the main interface.</p>

                        <p>I went over the top row of buttons.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I also made sure they knew the yellow start button</li>

                        <p>Once the kids were at this stage they started to have questions, and some of the things we talked about were:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How do you change the background?</li>

                        <p>We had a somewhat late snack, and all the kids continued working through it. At the end, kids showed off their original creations to the group--with some inattention :-)</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>I reviewed the homework individually, and then as a group we worked through all the steps of the homework. As a group we worked out the homework using the movement blocks to make the character visit all 4 corners. We also learned
                            how to turn on the grid to count how many steps the character should move in each direction.</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>Then we created a maze together as a class. This included review from the previous class of how to create a new project, how to add characters to a project, how to create a background picture, how to draw lines.</p>
                        <p>We also learned how to remove points from a line to make the line straight, how to paint the background of the screen, how to use the start trigger block, how to use the movement blocks to make the character move and the rotation
                            blocks to make the character face the direction they were moving. Children worked individually on making their own simple maze, and adjusted the parameters of their program to adjust their individual maze.</p>
                        <p>Children also learned how to change the size of a character, how to change the start position of the character, how to use the reset button to return the character to the original position.</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>Once they were able to make one character follow the maze, they then placed the other character at the end of the maze for the &quot;hero&quot; to &quot;defeat&quot; or &quot;rescue&quot;. Children learned how to use the &quot;contact&quot;
                            trigger block to initiate an action on contact, and how to record a sound and use the sound on contact. They also learned how to make a character disappear at that point.</p>

                        <p>We learned how to add a new screen to a project, and how to copy characters from one screen to the next. We used this to begin the homework.</p>

                        <p>The homework consists of:</p>

                            <li>
                                <p>Think about ways to make the maze more interesting. Some ideas we had included:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Add items for the character to get along the ways</li>
                                    <li>Make the maze more difficult by adding lines to the background.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Make a new maze, including at least:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>a new screen in the existing project</li>
                                    <li>a new background with more difficult maze</li>
                                    <li>actions and sounds when the final character is found</li>
                                    <li>additional items according to the kid's imagination</li>
                                </ul>
